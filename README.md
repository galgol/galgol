### A Little bit about myself :raising_hand:
I am a software developer, experienced in Python, mySQL, Redis, Mongo-DB, FastAPI.

I have experience working with Docker in a linux-based environment. 

I have proficiency in python frontend libraries such as python-Tkinter, python-pyqt and also knowledge in css.  

I am always eager to learn new technologies and solve problems.

I am a self-learner,creative, independent, have great teamwork skills and highly motivated.

#### Background:
[] Bsc in computer Science from Ben-Gurion University

#### Work Experience:
[] Software Developer - Okib
- Design, develop and deliver robotics application solutions using Robotics Operation System [ROS] and performing improvement in current application framework.
- Develop a monitoring system to quickly identify problem areas to begin trouble shooting root cause.
- Perform research into the design, operation and performance of robotics mechanism components and systems.
- 
[] Software Developer - Nano Dimension
- Design and implement container-based [Docker-ROS2] infrastructure solutions for large-scale data collection for the research team.
- Experiment, design & build client server communication using REST APIs and data storage solution [Redis], while maintaining quality, when facing environments with thousands of entities.

[] Software developer - Robotics lab Ben Gurion university
- Design and develop an infrastructure solution for autonomous Navigation of a robot using robot’s sensors, ROS packages and data storage solution [Mongo-DB].
- Develop map representation data structures for efficient localization and planning using ROS applications.
- Navigating a robot in the **real world** and in **Gazebo** simulator using the robot’s sensors (**lidar**) and
**odometry**. [link to git repo](https://github.com/galgol/tiago_public_ws/tree/master/src/navigation_margal)

[] Client-Server Project: 

During the corona :mask: I wanted to take a good use of time and improve my skills.
I decided to learn something new and along the way create a personal project that will use the new tools that I have learned.
#### My personal project (client-server) for learning to integrate databases (such as MySQL) in python. 
###### [You can check it out here](https://github.com/galgol/tasksServer)

The project is a TODO list, managed by **client-server mechanism** which I ran on my local computer. I have created 2 related tables according to the specifications (and logic I chose), and maintained a "simple approach" so that I can get things done and later on will be able to improve it (along with the learning :books: ). 
I chose to write in **Python** because I had worked with it in the past, and I wanted to continue and improve my skills and tool stack
(and it's also a cool language :heartbeat: ).
